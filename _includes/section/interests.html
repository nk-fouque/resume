                Be it working for my clubs or relaxing, I spend most of my time indoors.
                Fascinated by Japanese culture, watching animes and reading mangas or light novels are my primary
                hobbies.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I go out of my room, I still enjoy indoor activities,
                recently started learning Yosakoi and soon coming back to Archery.
