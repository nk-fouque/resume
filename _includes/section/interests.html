                Be it working for my clubs or relaxing, I spend most of my time indoors.
                Fascinated by Japanese culture, watching animes and reading mangas or light novels are my primary
                hobbies.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I go out of my room, I still enjoy indoor activities, I have recently come back to Archery
                thanks to my school's archery club, hoping to one day get back to the level that had lead me to
                regionals in high school.
                I also have a knack for Dance, Rock Dance to be specific, also in my school's club where I can work
                to improve myself in an atmosphere of constant exchange where everyone can learn from and teach to
                anyone.
