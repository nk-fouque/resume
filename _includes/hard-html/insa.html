        In France, engineering schools are a 3 year cursus you join after 2 years of preparatory cycle.
        Some schools like INSA Rennes, have their own internal preparatory cycle that you can enroll directly out of
        highschool to get better prepared for the specific things you do in that school; that's what I did.
