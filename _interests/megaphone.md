When I joined the webradio association of my school, I was only interested in the technical side of things at first,
I was the only person joining with the goal of becoming a technician, and that motivation got me appointed as the next Hardware Manager.  
Eventually the other sides of what that club had to offer interested me too and I got to lead some interviews and even write my own podcast.  
But I was still a technician at heart and my best achievements were made as a Sound Engineer and Audio Editor for several big interviews and a podcast written and presented by a friend of mine.  

This experience taught me that I could find hapiness in making the work of others shine.
