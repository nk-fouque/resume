FOG is a student festival that spans 48 hours where anyone can come and play board games from the club's massive collection.   
It also has an extensive Pen & Paper RPG listing which Game Masters can join on the fly to find players.  
After I joined as a volunteer during my freshman year I knew I wanted to help this club reach out to more people, 
so I took the duty of Communication vice-manager after my first festival, as the responsibilities were passed on annualy.  
My reponsibilities included communicating about the events that the club was organising all year long, 
as well as make the communication for the Festival.  
When it became my turn to pass my responsibilities down to the next person, 

I stayed with the club managing the partnership for pizzas on the Festival, a role that I gave my everything to during the festival, 
but allowed me to spend more time on other clubs during the rest of the year.
