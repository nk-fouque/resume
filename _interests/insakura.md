While talking with a friend of mine, we realized that a lot of people around us were big fans of the Japanese culture, 
and that these people tended to flock to the same clubs. 
But it was only by chance, and there might be even more people sharing the same interests that we might not have met because
there was no club that was really made for them.  
We made it our mission to create such a place, one that any person interested in Japan culture could turn to at first sight.  
We founded Insakura with that in mind, and started organising "Manga Caf√©" and Anime projection nights, 
to bring people interested in Japan's pop-culture and test out a potential public for more traditional activities.  

We are very proud of the platform we grew and we happily passed our responsibilities to the next generation as we moved forward in our studies.
