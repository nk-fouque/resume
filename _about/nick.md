I am a French engineering student studying computer science.  
<br>
I love Data Science, and being the guy who gives meaning to the numbers.  
  
**Graduating in 2021, actively looking for a job after that, open to relocation all around the world**  

I'd like to work in **Data Visualization**, ideally between the algorithm and the analysis, where I can
apply my skills in **Software Engineering** to develop tools for visualization  
I am also well versed in **Machine Learning** and **Cloud computing**.
