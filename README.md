# Welcome

This project has been originally developed as a mean to :
- Learn to use github-pages
- Learn to develop websites using Bootstrap and HTML
- Serve as my CV and showcase my projects

## Development

I've loved Jekyll since the moment I discovered it, I'm happy to be able to put out some complex pages without backend  
I'm always adding new content to this template because I want to see how far I can take it  
I'm also trying to always use more Bootstrap functions.

### Current focus

- Finish migrating content from html files to data files 
(So that if someone wants to use it as a Jekyll template they don't have to look into the layouts)
- New content to get to know me, especially content not about IT

# Credits

## Resume
Started as a template [Resume](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-resume) from Start Bootstrap and added more and more of personal content
## Art
- Profile picture by [Kiri](http://www.kiri-illustratrice.com/), don't hesitate to check her work she's awesome and also a close friend of mine
- Logos for INSA associations obtained from internal resources meant for external communication

## Other Logos
Most of these logos have been edited to have a grey/blue version to coincide with the theme  
- [Golang Logo](https://blog.golang.org/go-brand) 
- [Bash Logo](https://bashlogo.com/)  
- Ruby Logo *Source is missing, if you know it please tell me*  
- [C++ Logo](https://freebiesupply.com/logos/c-logo/)  
- [Kubernetes Logo](https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/kubernetes/index.html)  
- [Jetbrains Logo](https://www.jetbrains.com/company/brand/logos/)  
- [Adobe Icons by Freepik](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)  
... Other logos are most likely part of the fontawesome content included with the Start Bootstrap template

# Commits

Inspired by Angular's contributing guidelines this is meant as git hygiene rules for myself, as I'm not expecting anyone to contribute to this   
The title of a commit follows this pattern : \<type>(\<scope>): \<subject>

## Type
- content: Changes / additions to the mardown/yml files that only impact the site's content
- docs: Documentation only changes
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- refactor: Modification of the code without adding features nor bugs (rename, white-space, ...)
- style: CSS or layout modifications or debug
- serve: Built the site using serve command, this type of commit doesn't need a subject, normally this should only make modifications in ```docs```
